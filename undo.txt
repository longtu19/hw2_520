On the view, next to the Add Transaction buttom, we add a Delete Transaction button.
Controller: 
On the ExpenseTrackerApp.java, addd a action listener to the Delete Transaction button.
When the user select the row and press on the Delete Transaction button, the action listener gets 
the amount and category field and call the removeTransaction method in ExpenseTrackerController
Create a removeTransaction which takes an amount and category, validates them and create a 
new Transaction with those values and passes the new Transaction to the model by calling 
the removeTransaction method from the model.
The controller then remove the transaction from the table and calls on the view to refresh the table
