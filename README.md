## Code modification
Apply encapsulation for the list of transactions by making the transactions list 
private but keep all the functions that can access it public
Apply immutability to the Transaction class by making all fields of the class private
and remove all setter methods
Create the Transaction filter interface and create two filter strategies (category, amount)
that implement said interface
Update the view and controller to accomodate the new feature
